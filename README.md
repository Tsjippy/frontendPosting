This module makes it possible to add and edit pages, posts and custom post types.<br>
Just place this shortcode on any page: <code>[front_end_post]</code>.<br>
An overview of the posts created by the current user can be displayed using the: <code>[your_posts]</code> shortcode.<br>
If anyone without publish rights tries to add or edit a page, it will be stored as pending.<br>
An overview of pending content can be shown using the <code>[pending_pages]</code> shortcode.<br>
You can use the <code>[pending_post_icon]</code> shortcode as an indicator, displaying the amount of pending posts in menu items.<br>
This module also adds a custom post status: archived. Meaning a post is not visible but still kept for reference
